# Postgres Connection Walkthrough

This exercise is designed to get you familiar with connecting to a database, querying it and viewing that information.
We'll be using the NPM module PG to connect our node server to a locally-hosted Postgres database.

Inspired by [Matthew Glover](https://github.com/matthewglover) and his awesome [pg-app](https://github.com/matthewglover/pg-app/blob/master/get_pups.js)

What you will learn in this exercise:
- Creating a database
- Connecting to a database
- Querying a database
- Viewing that information
