# Postgres Connection Walkthrough

This exercise is designed to get you familiar with connecting to a database, querying it and viewing that information.
We'll be using the [npm module `pg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) to connect our node server to a locally-hosted Postgres database.

Inspired by [Matthew Glover](https://github.com/matthewglover) and his awesome [pg-app](https://github.com/matthewglover/pg-app/)

What you will learn in this exercise:
- Creating a database
- Connecting to a database
- Querying a database
- Viewing that information
